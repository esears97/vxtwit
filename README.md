# vxtwit
Chrome Extension that adds a button to every tweet which copies the link as a vxtwitter link. Makes discord embeds not broken

It's not great code but it works (mostly).
Just don't try to copy a tweet from anyone who's username starts with analytics. It won't work but I'm going to bed so I'm not fixing it
